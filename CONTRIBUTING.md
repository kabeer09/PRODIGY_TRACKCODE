# Cat-Dog Classification Project

## Overview

This project aims to classify images as either a cat or a dog using machine learning techniques. The model has been trained on a dataset of cat and dog images to make predictions on new, unseen data.

## Getting Started

Follow these instructions to set up the project on your local machine.

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- Pip (Python package installer)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/cat-dog-classification.git
    ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

    ```bash
    cd cat-dog-classification
    ```

3. Install the required dependencies:

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Usage

1. **Data Preparation:**

    - Place your cat and dog images in the `data` directory.
    - Ensure that the images are organized into subdirectories, such as `data/train/cat`, `data/train/dog`, `data/test/cat`, and `data/test/dog`.

2. **Training:**

    - Run the training script to train the model:

        ```bash
        python train.py
        ```

    - Adjust hyperparameters in the `config.yaml` file as needed.

3. **Prediction:**

    - Use the trained model to make predictions on new images:

        ```bash
        python predict.py --image_path path/to/your/image.jpg
        ```

4. **Evaluate:**

    - Evaluate the model performance on a test dataset:

        ```bash
        python evaluate.py
        ```
